===== code loom info =====
====================================================================================================
code loom is a tool that allows the user to write a set of test cases and a source code file (in
java) and test if the program passes all the test cases.

The tool has some built in test files that the user can explore as well.

====================================================================================================
===== help flags =====
====================================================================================================

-h or -help
    help is used to bring up the help menu.

-hc or -h check
    check is used when the user wants to run the program with the check cases. The check cases are
usually general test cases to see if the program is functional to some capacity. The tests are not
as rigorous and don't check many if any edge cases. When the program is run with check as the
argument the program will use the defualt file (input.sul) and run it with the check flag.

-hd or -h default
    default is used when the user is not sure which one they want to run between check and submit.
default will run the program with the default file (input.sul).


-hl or -h list
    list will bring up a list of all the programs the tool has test files for. The user can then
specify which one to run.

-hs or -h submit
    submit is used when the user wants to run the program with all the testcases. This would usually
include more rigorous testing and  edge cases or special cases that are omitted when the check is
run. When the tool is run with submit as the argument the tool will use the default file (input.sul)
and run it with the submit flag.

-hp or -h program
    program is used when the user wants to run a specific program that the tool has a test file for
The user also needs to specify the number associated with the program (run list to see this).
Example: "program 2" will run the second program in the lisr.

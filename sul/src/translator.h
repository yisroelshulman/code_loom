/*
 * Trasnlate is the function that is responsible for translating a .sul file into test cases and
 * string the test case in the io.
 * 
 * After a successful call to translate the caller can expect the io to contain the all the test 
 * cases.
 * If there was a read error then io will not be modified in any way.
 * If there are any errors during the translation the test case in which the error occurred will not
 * be added to the io
 * 
 * @param const char* path
 *      the path to the .sul file that we want to translate
 * @param IO* io
 *      the io where the test cases will be stored
 * 
 * @returns
 *      SUCCESS:            if no error occurred during the translation
 *      READ_ERROR:         if the .sul file is not found or there was an error reading the file
 *      TRANSLATION_ERROR:  if an error occurred during the translation process
